<h1>TODAY I START GIT</h1>

<p>After undergoing some difficulties and sleepless nights I have started mastering some skills in GIT<br>Although I can't say I am at an advanced stage but I am grateful for the knowledge I have gathered so far.</p>

<p> I am looking forward towards gaining as much experience as possible through studies and research not forgetting the most important which is through practicals so thst I can have my skills in handy</p>

<p>Nothing is impossible under the sun as long as there is<br><b><i>hardwork and determination.</i><b/>
